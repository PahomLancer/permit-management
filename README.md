# Permit Management Module

Manage the acquisition of building permits, zoning approvals, and other permits. A project may have multiple permits and each permit is associated with a common Jurisdiction tracker. The automated Permit status field will auto-calculate and display the status of each permit on each site. 

A workplan schedule guides each permit through the approval process. Permits and associated documentation can be uploaded. The automated Countdown Days field will auto-calculate and display the days remaining before permit expiration. Daily rules will identify any permits that are due to expire before the forecast construction start date and require an extension.
